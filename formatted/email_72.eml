Hello,  
  
This is Eli Zafrani from Getty Advance, I tried reaching you but
couldn't get in touch with you, I am just reaching out because we
received your file from a broker a couple of days back regarding extra working capital but we never heard back from the broker with the approval we gave. 
Now that the grace period between us and the broker is over, I am reaching out to you exclusively as the investor. Here's the offer I had for you.  
  
Type Starter Approval  
Offer Amount $100,000  
Factor 1.2  
Payback $120,000  
Payment $1,500  
Schedule Weekly # of Payments 80  
  
Notes: We need updated application filled out & last 4 months bank
statements.

Hereis the application link: Application Link  
We do have better offers as well as consolidations. If you aren't
interested please let me know so I can cross you off the list.Thank You!
