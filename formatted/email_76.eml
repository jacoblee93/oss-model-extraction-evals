Hey, Jacob. We wanted to give you a heads up.  
Access to your free credit score with Mint will be moving to Credit Karma in
the future. But don't fret. We've made moving over fast and
easy.  
If you already have a Credit Karma account, then you're good to go.
Need an account? We've made it a breeze to sign up.
