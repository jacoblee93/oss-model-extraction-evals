Hello Jacob,

  

Do you know what Fortune 50 giants like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and
Microsoft have in common?

  

They all stand atop a mountain of mistakes, each contributing to their even=
tual and continuing success.

  

Failure is integral in the path to greatness -- whether refining your
product or service through testing its multiple iterations, investing in
R&D, or experimenting with diverse marketing strategies, the trial-and-error
process is absolutely critical for your business growth.

  

But, many businessesare very risk-averse, primarily due to a lack of capital
-- they cannot fail because they cannot afford to do so without taking a
major hit to their finances. It's a dilemma that hinders their ability to
explore, make mistakes, and unearth the breakthroughs that truly work.
