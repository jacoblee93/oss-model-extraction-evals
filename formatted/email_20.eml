Newsom Signed Our Bill to Expand Access to Addiction Treatment for Youth!  
  
---  
  
  
Dear Jacob,  
  

I have some wonderful news to share with you! The Governor has signed my bill,
**AB 816: Medication Assisted Treatment for Youth** ; now, **physicians will
be able to enroll people 16 and older in buprenorphine treatment for opioid
addiction.**

The bill aims to reduce the number of overdose deaths among minors and
represents a step forward in a statewide problem. Currently, overdose deaths
**account for 1 out of every 5 deaths of those under 18 in California.** In
fact, **overdose deaths among minors have doubled in California over the last
2 years.** These numbers illustrate the severity of the crisis and the need to
expand the availability of treatment to youth. Many of the youth suffering
from addiction are living on our streets with no home or family to call on for
support or consent.

**Enrolling opioid-addicted youth** in medically proven treatments early is
one of the best tools physicians have to **save the lives of these young
people and prevent lifelong addiction.**

The Governor's signing of AB 816 enables California to join nine other states
in implementing laws that allow youth 16+ to consent to medical treatment for
substance use disorder. To learn more about the impact of this bill, visit
Kron 4 News.

Together, we are working to address this crisis, and we remain dedicated to
our mission of saving the lives of our young Californians.

Sincerely,

Matt Haney  
Assemblymember, 17th District
