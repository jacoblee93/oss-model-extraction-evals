Hi Jacob, it's Scott.  
 
=0AIt's been the honor of my life to represent San Francisco and
northern San Mateo County for the past seven years in the California State
Senate. **Today, I'm proud to announce my run for re-election for a
third term.**  
 
=0ATogether, we've accomplished more than anyone thought possible on
housing. We've fought for LGBTQ rights, particularly for LGBTQ
youth, in the faceof a massive surge in anti-LGBTQ hate. We've
passed sweeping climate action laws. We've worked tirelessly to get
people suffering on our streets into treatment. And we're not
stopping. I will continueto fight on the issues that matter most to our
community.  
 
=0AUnfortunately, our progress has also made me a target for bigots across
the country. They've made clear they're against everything
we stand for and will try to obstruct our campaign however they can.  
 
=0ABut my campaigns have always been a team effort, powered by people like =
you. I can't do this without your support =E2=80=93 and I=
wouldn't want to. Will you join my re-election campaign as a found=

will continue to fight on the issues that matter most to our community, like
mental health and addiction treatment, housing affordability, improving and
funding public transportation, supportingworkers, improving public safety,
and so much more. In total, I'veauthored 75 bills that have been
signed into law; I've shepherded tens of millions of dollars in
funding from the State budget to support local priorities, and I played a
key role delivering major public transportation investment this past year.  
 
I am so grateful for the trust the community has placed in me to do this
work, and I will continue working hard every day for San Francisco and
northern San Mateo County.
