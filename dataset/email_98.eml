Hi!  
  
I just announced that I will be running for a third term in the
Senate. The response from all of you has been overwhelming. From the bottom
of my heart, thank you for your support.  
  
Considering how big this moment is, it's only fitting that we throw a
big party to celebrate the occasion, so my team is hard at work planning our
biggest event of the year... the Craft Beer Bash!  
  
Will you buy tickets today=3F  
  
We'll be taking over BareBottle Brewing Company in Bernal Heights on
November 29th at 6pm to taste some of San Francisco's best craft brews. The
first drink is on us!  
  
I hope you'll join us, so we can show just how much momentum our
campaign has going into 2024. **RSVP TODAY >>**
