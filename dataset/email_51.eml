We Passed the Stop Dangerous Pharmacies Act!  
  
---  
  
Sacramento - November 13, 2023

  
Dear Jacob,  
  

The Governor has signed my bill **AB 1286, the Stop Dangerous Pharmacies
Act!** AB 1286 will establish first-in-the-nation regulations to crack down on
what has become a nationwide problem of understaffed chain pharmacies making
dangerous medication errors.

**The LA Times reported** that California pharmacies are making almost 5
million medication errors a year. A recent survey conducted by the California
Board of Pharmacy reported that **91% pointed to a lack of adequate staffing**
and, furthermore, **83% of pharmacists reported that they didn't have
sufficient time to provide appropriate consultations** to patients to make
sure they understand how to safely take their medications.

Up until now, decisions about staffing and safety have been made by chain
store management rather than the pharmacist who has undertaken years of
education to safely provide sometimes dangerous medications. AB 1286 gives
licensed pharmacy staff more autonomy over staffing and working conditions so
they can provide better patient care and services for Californians.

Sincerely,

Matt Haney  
Assemblymember, 17th District
