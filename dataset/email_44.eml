Hello Jacob,

  

For many small businesses, year-end or Q4 can account for a whopping 75% of
profits.

  

With holidays just around the corner, customers are gearing up to spend BIG.
That means the busy season is just a blink away.

  

But to achieve and meet the soaring demand also requires higher inventory,
additional staffing,and a beefed-up marketing budget.

  

EMC is here to supercharge your busy season preparations. With our services,
you can be fully armed to smash your sales targets.

  

Kickstart your funding application now and see if you qualify.

  

Best,

Sam at EMC
