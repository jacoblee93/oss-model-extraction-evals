Happy Halloween, Jacob!

You may be a lover of the coast redwoods but doyou ever think
about how the forests are a tad _spooky_


It's not just the bats like me swooping overhead. Think about it:
Leaves whisper across the forest floor, cave-liketree hollows create perfect
hiding places for monsters, ghostly fog descends over the canopy, and every
old-growth redwood hides centuries of secrets!


 **We love spooky season at Save the Redwoods League, and we've
rounded up some Halloween fun for you.**




  *  **Play RedWordle!=** Four Wordle-inspired puzzles to get you thinking and learningabout the forests.


  *  **Download redwood-inspired Jack-o-Lantern templates** and bring some light to this dark night.


  *  **Take our Spooky Redwood Quiz** to delve into the eerie _mist-eries_ of the coast redwood forests.


These spooky treats are perfect for October, but forest devotion is
evergreen, and we hope your forest love will never be _fog-otten_.


My forest friends also thought up some forest-themed jokes to tickle your
funnybone.


 **Sunny the Banana Slug's Jokes:






**Now, a couple of bat-themed chuckles for you:**






 **And some owl humor towrap it up:**






And don't forget to keepyour secrets safe from owls; they're always talon
everyone and love hoo-dunits! Have a fun (and spooky!) day.
